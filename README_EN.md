# My Expense Vulnerable Web Application

## Challenge details

**Difficulty :** Easy
**Type :** Realist / Web (not a boot 2 root machine)
**Technologies :** PHP / MySQL
**Network :** DHCP

## Description

MyExpense is a deliberately vulnerable web application that allows you to train in detecting and exploiting different web vulnerabilities. Unlike a more traditional "challenge" application (which allows you to train on a single specific vulnerability), MyExpense contains a set of vulnerabilities you need to exploit to achieve the whole scenario.

## Scenario

You are "Samuel Lamotte" and you have just been fired by your company "Furtura Business Informatique". 
Unfortunately because of your hasty departure, you did not have time to validate your expense report for your last business trip, which still amounts to 750 € corresponding to a return flight to your last customer. 

Fearing that your former employer may not want to reimburse you for this expense report, you decide to hack into the internal application called **"MyExpense "** to manage employee expense reports.

So you are in your car, in the company carpark and connected to the internal Wi-Fi (the key has still not been changed after your departure). The application is protected by username/password authentication and you hope that the administrator has not yet modified or deleted your access.

Your credentials were: samuel/fzghn4lw

Once the challenge is done, the flag will be displayed on the application while being connected with your (samuel) account.
